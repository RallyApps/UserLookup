## Overview

The User Lookup app provides easy access to user details.

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/UserLookup/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

You can view all users, filter by a specific letter, or enter a search string filter. Additionally, you can edit a user by clicking the edit icon to open the user editor.

<b>NOTE:</b> The functionality of this app has led to enhanced user administration in Rally. Before installing this app, we recommend you review the Users pages in Rally (Setup > Users page, or Setup > Workspaces & Projects > Project detail page > Users page). If this app provides unique functionality you would like to see in Rally, please let us know by [contacting our support team](https://rally1.rallydev.com/slm/help.sp?pp=contact).

This app requires subscription or workspace permissions to view or edit users.

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.

## License

UserLookup is released under the MIT license. See the file [LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/UserLookup/master/LICENSE) for the full text.
